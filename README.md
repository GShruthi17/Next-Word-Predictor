# Next-Word-Predictor
Although writing lengthy lines might be tedious, text prediction technology built into keyboards has made this process simple. Additionally known as language modeling, next word prediction. Predicting the first word that will be said is the task at hand. It has several uses and is one of the main tasks of human language technology. Long short time memory(LSTM) formula can recognise previous text and anticipate words that might be helpful for the user to construct sentences. This approach uses letter to letter prediction, which implies that it predicts a letter when a letter is used to form a word.
